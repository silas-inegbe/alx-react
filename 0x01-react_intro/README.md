# 0x01. React intro

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

## Features of React

1. **Components**: React code is made of entities called components. Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components.

2. **One-way Data Binding**: React's one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. 

3. **Virtual DOM**: React utilises a virtual DOM, and it can update and render specific components when data changes. This provides a significant performance boost.

4. **Simplicity**: React is straightforward to understand and learn. It requires less coding and offers more functionality.

## Getting Started with React

To get started with React, you can use the `create-react-app` command-line tool. 

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
2. Run `npx create-react-app my-app` in your terminal to create a new React application.
3. Navigate into your new project folder with `cd my-app`.
4. Start the development server and open the app in your browser with `npm start`.

Your new React application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
